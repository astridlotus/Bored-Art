# Bored, Art

## Website Description
This website randomly generates something for you to do if you're bored, and finds a cool piece of art that goes along with it! I used boredAPI to generate a random activity and used the activity type to query an art piece from the Institute of Chicago API. I used Skeleton Screens to make the website look a little cleaner while loading. 

Users can choose to look at just art, or also try and find something to do. 

## Technologies Used & Collaboration
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Challenges and Features
The biggest challenge for me was the look of the website, having the art citation load before the image and what not. I ended up using skeleton screens which I feel could be updated further to look even cleaner.
